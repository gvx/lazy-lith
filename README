Lith, a minimal data description language

To use this, you need python (tested with 2.6 and 3.1).

USAGE

    python parse_tree.py
        Parses a tree from stdin, prints it on stdout.

    python eval_tree.py
        Parses and evaluates a tree from stdin, prints it on stdout.

    python write_tree.py
        Generates canonicalized Lith source code from source code provided on
        stdin.

The Python files all contain functions with the same name as their filename,
with the following profiles:

    tree = parse_tree(text)
    tree = eval_tree(tree)
    text = write_tree(tree)

ABOUT LITH

Lith is a minimal description language, built around two core concepts: T
(true) and [] (lists). An empty list is false, everything else is true.

Numbers are represented by repetitions of T in a list. Thus 3 is [ T T T ].

Strings are represented by lists of numeric codes.

A number of operations can be used on lists or T. They are explained in more
detail at http://gvxdev.wordpress.com/2011/04/10/lith-revisited/.
